The data is peaches.csv.

Download the peachpriceproject.Rmd file and the peaches.csv file. Place the files in your working directory in Rstudio. Open "peachpriceproject.Rmd" in Rstudio and run all code. Knit the file. Once the following steps are completed, you should be able to reproduce my report exactly.

To view my report via browser:

Go to the peachpriceproject.html file. Click on the three dots and press "Download". The file will download on the browser. Once the downloaded file is clicked on, a new tab containing my report will open.
